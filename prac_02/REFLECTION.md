## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

i think it's the do this now part which lindsay asked us to do. Every time i will follow the instruction and do the work first then watch how he do it.
It really helps me because i can tell a lot of difference between his design and mine which make me learn a lot of new things. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I think it's the part how i design my code. I think my way of designing is way to sophisticated which make the efficiency really bad.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

currently i dont think i am doing poorly. But sometimes i felt struggled because i dont really understand the question. Like the email i sent to 
Mrs CHan, i feel unsure about the score i earn because i think i know all the knowledge we currently studied but sometimes i cant fully follow the 
instruction of the practical because i cant understand all of it. 

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I think it's the debugging, i can almost figure out evry bug i met without the help of searching online.
