# CP1404 Practicals
## About myself and this repository 
This repo is made by myself. I am the second semester of JCU, and this is not the first time i learn 
about programming but still find python very challenging because it has so many unknown ideas.
## Lessons learnt 
- explain your function so that more readable
- do the whole work then extract each small parts into the new functions
- keep functions small and focused on a single task
