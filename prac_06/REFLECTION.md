## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
I think what I have changed is the way of designing my project. Initially I just write by top to bottom by what I think and then I add small special needs. Now I design the whole format first then specify the small parts

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
I think the thing I need to change is the attitude of solving the problem. All I do is just if I can finish and the output is okay then it's okay. I won't give further investigation on those questions .

Learning the lecture every week before go to classes.
